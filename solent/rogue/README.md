This rogue package is a mess. There is broken functionality in here. Most of
it is a legacy of the project that solent evolved from. There are issues in
github to clear it up, and this message is here to warn people to be wary of
the code in the meantime. At a guess, the code that works will be moved into
solent.demo.weeds so that this demo continues to work. Then the rest of the
package will be deleted.

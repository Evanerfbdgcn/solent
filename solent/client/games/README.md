# Why is this here?

The package solent.client is about building a terminal interface.

In order to help me along with that, I've been building small game ideas in
here. This has allowed me to move the solent.client forwards to a point where
it is usable without having to be distracted by the concurrency work.

There's no reason that it should be impossible to develop future games in this
manner, but this is not the recommended approach. You'll be much better off
using an eng at the centre of your game.

(This should give you an understanding why this area is here all the same.
Expect it to be gradually diffused into other packages over time, particularly
as eng-hosted games become viable.)
